        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <div class="myapproach text-center mx-auto col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
          <p>My approach is client-centered, trauma informed relational and somatic therapy. We will place focus on how your early relationships in life shaped your experiences and understanding of yourself and your relationships with others, in your present day life.
          In order to help us understand where you are holding traumatic experiences  and how we can help them find movement, we will be attuning to your nervous system and paying attention to the sensations, emotions and thoughts that come forward.
          Focusing into our bodies instead of everything that distracts us outside of our bodies can bring about great healing and can foster a deeper connection within ourselves.
          You may be struggling with stress, PTSD, anger management, childhood abuse or trauma, depression and relationship issues.
          I work collaboratively with my clients to heal any issues they present with in a non-judgemental and supportive environment with a personal strong focus on empathy. Personal spiritual growth is an area I specialize in, in addition to assisting the client to restore communication, trust, emotional connection and intimacy in their relationships. </p>
          <p class="largertext"><strong>My focus within our therapeutic session is to assist the client to heal the important relationship they have with themselves.</strong></p>
          <p>My objective is to work with you in order to explore the issues troubling you, identify what you want, and to help you feel more in control of your life. I incorporate various practice models such as cognitive-behavioural, narrative, psychodynamic, mindfulness, Inner child work, body psychotherapy and solution focused therapies as appropriate to my client’s needs. I  see clients in person or via Zoom conferencing.</p>
