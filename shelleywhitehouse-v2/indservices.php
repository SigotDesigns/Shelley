                <h2>Spiritual Therapy</h2>
                <p>Spiritual Psychotherapy is an innovative approach to psychotherapy which attempts to treat the needs of the soul and the spirit, as well as the mind and body by accessing individual belief systems and using that faith in a higher power to explore areas of conflict in life.</p>
​                <p>People who believe in a guiding power may find spiritual therapy helps them achieve a deeper connection with this power.</p>
                <p>Some components of this approach would include: Meditation, Chakra work, Communing with nature, music and other non-traditional therapeutic practices all of which may be employed in an effort to connect the body and mind with the soul and explore the deepest part of one's self.</p>
                <p>While spirituality is often categorized with religion, one's spirituality may have nothing to do with religion but be simply an awareness of the universe and one's connection to it.</p>
                <p>Often, individuals who describe themselves as spiritual state their desire to attain a feeling of harmony with the universe and pursue spiritual therapy in an effort to achieve this goal.</p>
                <p>So what is spiritual? The word itself indicates it is related to ‘spirit’. Again this can bring up different meanings and feelings for you. For me, spirit is simply a non physical part of our being which knows more about us than our everyday consciousness. It can also be described as the true self, the real self, higher self, supra consciousness, etc. The original meaning of the word ‘psychotherapy’ comes from Greek, meaning ‘healing of the soul’ [psyche(soul) and therapeia (healing)]. I like this definition as I find it a great reminder of what therapy is about or can be about, which for me is healing at a deep level. You may come across counsellors who have had training in transpersonal psychotherapy. ‘Transpersonal’ is a lovely way to describe that which lies beyond the ‘personal’, i.e. the ‘I’ and moves into the realm of the higher self nature. You may wonder if transpersonal and psycho-spiritual psychotherapists only deal with the spiritual aspects of the self. That is not so. Transpersonal psychotherapy training includes the major approaches to counselling and psychotherapy. As a result, transpersonal counsellors also work with recognising links and patterns from the past, with changing thoughts and behaviour and looking at the potential in each person towards growth, as well as working with the more spiritual aspects if appropriate. So what does it have to do with psychotherapy?</p>
                <p>If you want to make real changes to yourself, I think it is essential to connect with your true self. Who are you really underneath all the difficulties that you face? What are you learning? What qualities are you developing or need to develop? By connecting more with that core part of yourself you can have access to a part that can transcend the difficulties that you may identify with. So how does this all translate into practice?</p>
                <p>There are different ways that this can be used practically. Each person is unique and brings different issues and goals to therapy, so many counsellors take their lead from the person in how far the spiritual aspect becomes a direct way of working or not. Therefore, you do not need to feel spiritual or have any interest in spirituality to benefit from a psycho-spiritual approach to counselling and psychotherapy. You can experience great healing and relief from being able to share your story in a safe, confidential and non judgemental space. That may be all you want. Perhaps you simply want to learn strategies to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, relationship or family issues for example. Or you want to make more lasting changes to yourself that are underlying your symptoms, especially if you have recurring difficulties and patterns of behaviour that are limiting your life satisfaction. Whereas most psychotherapies aim to help you to become a more balanced and integrated person, to help you manage stress and find more fulfilment in life, a spiritual approach also allows for a very positive way of understanding difficulties and connect with parts of yourself that you were unaware of. In addition, I find that the spiritual heart can help to reduce and clear many negative emotions and can help you to function from a place of loving kindness and compassion to yourself and others, which is fundamental to greater happiness. </p>

            <!-- INNER CHILD THERAPY -->

            <div class="team3 mx-auto">
              <div class="doctor m-1 p-4 text-justify mx-auto col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
                <h2>Inner Child Work</h2>
                <p>Your Inner Child is the echo of the child you once were. We each have our own history and we have all been influenced by our environment, events and the significant people around us. Our inner child has stored those memories, and their impact upon us.</p>
​
                <p>Up to the age of six years, our brain was functioning at a relatively slow pace —the Theta brainwave frequency of 4-7 cycles per second—which is a very ‘receptive’ brainwave state, and we would have been profoundly affected by our experiences. We will have made ‘decisions’ at a sub-conscious level, about how we ‘should’ be and what we ‘should’ do in order to be seen as OK, and to be allowed to 'be accepted' and to ‘survive’ in our families.</p>

                <p>Our later experiences will have reinforced these beliefs and formed our own ‘Script’ for how our life ‘should’ be. We carry these immature scripts and decisions with us into adulthood — when they run our lives more than 90% of the time.
                It therefore makes sense that we should revisit the experiences of the child we once were, and to find out what our own script says about our life and the unfolding drama we have been re-creating and repeating.
                Not doing so will result in our playing out of the same unexamined script and drama over and over again.
                We cannot change the script by talking about it, or by conscious effort alone. It was designed to keep us safe—albeit in ways that now hinder us—and so it isn’t given up that easily!
                Most of the time we are living life like a child inside a grown-up's body - and the child within us yearns for attention, understanding, care and support.</p>

                <p>We may try to silence these deeper longings with alcohol or drugs, by promiscuity, gambling, over-spending, over-eating, work-a-holism, self-harming and other ways of avoiding the real and deeper needs we have. Needs which we haven’t allowed ourselves to become fully aware of, or to find a way to have sufficiently met.</p>

                <p class="largertext">Signs that your Inner Child is wounded</p>

                <p>These will be shown in low self-esteem, poor body-image, mood and emotional imbalances, problems with boundaries being too rigid or too weak, problems with eating, harming yourself, psycho-sexual difficulties, being ‘false’ and wearing ‘masks’, identity problems, being a rebel/ a hoarder/ a bully/ a perennial victim or a super-achiever, intimacy problems, commitment problems, a general lack of trust in yourself and others, criminal behaviour, excessive lying, being ‘overly-responsible’ for others, being fiercely competitive and a poor loser, dependencies and addictions, a lack of genuine friends, obsessive and needy behaviour, fear of authority figures, being manipulative, being passive, or being aggressive.
                That’s a long—and sadly not exhaustive—list. It is the stuff that brings people into psychotherapy. To repair and heal the wounds caused by parents, and others, who didn’t know any better. It is always about the unmet needs of the Inner Child - the place of both our early wounding and the most profound healing!</p>

                <p class="largertext">What can we do to help our wounded Inner Child?</p>

                <p>We can learn how to meet, rescue and ‘adopt’ this wounded child who still lives deep inside us. After all, you are the only person who you can guarantee never to leave you!
                We can then emotionally contain and soothe our Inner Child, and allow the Competent Adult inside us to ‘attend to business’ out in the world.
                However, we must regularly keep in touch with what our Inner Child still needs from us—which is, to be truly cared for by someone who wants the very best for them—that's you!
                If you have a photograph of yourself as a small child, this will help you to empathically reconnect with him/her— the aim of which is to now understand their plight and to show them/yourself the compassion which has been missing.</p>

                <p>It is often easier to feel compassion for other people than it is for yourself and you may have been rejecting and ignoring the yearning of your Inner Child - who has been calling out to you, over many years, for your interest, attention, compassion and love.
                It may mean you now allowing yourself to have ‘treats’ and rewards that you would never have allowed yourself, or have been allowed by your parents, in the past.
                The sensible competent Adult part of you should be able to set fair and sensible boundaries around this, so that you do not over-indulge yourself, or use any rewards as either a distraction or as a cover up for your deeper pain.</p>

                <p>[If you have difficulties accessing this Adult part of your inner psyche then psychotherapy will be of help to you, providing that it includes this aspect of integrating the hidden or lost aspects of your character and personality, to help you on your path to becoming a more well-rounded and complete person.]
                Rescuing and re-parenting your Inner Child will allow you to ‘fill in the gaps’ and enable you to live a more positive and rewarding life—with fun, laughter, spontaneity, authenticity, and most importantly, with love.</p>

                <h2>Body Psychotherapy</h2>
                <p>Body psychotherapy, a branch of therapy that focuses on the interactions between the body and the mind, is founded on the principle of the body and mind working in functional unity. Drawing from several branches of science and psychology, this approach to treatment is a versatile therapy that can be utilized in both individual and group therapy approaches. Body psychotherapy incorporates touch, breathing, and movement techniques to address a wide range of mental and physical health concerns that may lead people to seek therapy.</p>
                <p class="largertext">Essential Concepts of Body Psychotherapy</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Bodymind:</span> Perhaps the most foundational concept of body psychotherapy, the bodymind represents the embodied integration of thoughts, feelings, and physical bodily experiences and sensations. All parts of a person can be accessed at various points in treatment in order to effectively and holistically address concerns.</li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Armoring and Character:</span> Armoring is a concept developed by Reich. He believed people developed systems of bodily “armor,” or muscle tension/rigidity, in order to protect themselves from emotional and physical pain. These sets of armor contribute to the development of a person’s “character," according to Reich and his followers, who developed five character types to use during assessment. </li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Energy:</span> The concept of energy is central to the application of body psychotherapy. Energy stored in and released from the body plays an important role in how people carry themselves, experience and heal from pain, and interact with the world. Things like energy flow and release, muscle pulsation and contraction, and energy charge and discharge are all things body psychotherapists pay attention to throughout treatment. </li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Body Memory:</span> This is the controversial premise that memories can actually be stored within the body. Body psychotherapists believe that because of this, some memories cannot be processed through talk therapy, but that these traumatic memories and problematic tension can often be released through bodywork and other physical techniques. </li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Trauma:</span> Body psychotherapy’s concept of trauma aligns with that of body memory, proposing that traumatic experiences can create energy build-up, or blockages, that lead to physical and mental health concerns. </li>
                  </ul>

                <p class="largertext">Techniques Used in Body Psychotherapy</p>

                <p>When a person begins body psychotherapy, the first session might follow a format similar to a talk therapy session. The therapist will typically first conduct assessments to gather information about presenting concerns, interpersonal relationships, and the person’s experiences with loss, trauma, and abuse. The therapist will also utilize body reading, an assessment technique that helps identify how a person’s body might be communicating crucial information. Once the presenting concerns have been identified and the goals for treatment established, the therapist will employ various techniques designed to bring about a heightened awareness of both the body and mind. These chosen techniques are tailored to meet each person’s unique set of needs based upon the presenting mental health concerns, observations of the body, and the person’s capacity for insight and awareness.</p>
                <p>Therapists might incorporate aspects of Gestalt therapy dialogue, <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/dance-movement-therapy" target="_blank">dance/movement therapy</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/somatic-experiencing" target="_blank">somatic experiencing</a>, along with the following techniques: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Centering:</span>The therapist helps the person look inward and stabilize from the inside out. </li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Grounding:</span>The therapist asks the person in therapy to attune themselves to the flow of energy from their body to the ground. Stretching, vibration, and breathing exercises are taught to the person in treatment in order to help them experience a sense of connection to this flow of energy.</li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Contact and Bodywork:</span>The therapist uses therapeutic touch to call attention to body tension, encourage relaxation, or support the person's work in adjusting to safe touch. This practice might include techniques that range from a reassuring hand on the shoulder to biodynamic massage. Bodywork can also come in the form of dance/movement therapy interventions.</li>
                    <li><span class="largertext">Breathwork:</span>Based on the assumption that people sometimes stop breathing when they want to block feelings, <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/breathwork" target="_blank">breathwork</a> techniques support people in reconnecting with their breath to bring about balance and relaxation.</li>

                <h2>Relationship Therapy</h2>
                <p class="largertext">EFT stands for Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy</p>
​                <p>This approach to seeing relationships – as an attachment bond – and shaping more loving relationships is leading the  couple relationship field into a new understanding of romantic love. We now have a map to the territory called love and we can empower couples by showing them new systematic ways to take control of dances of disconnection and conflict and, even more important, help each other move into the open close embrace that is a secure loving bond. </p>
                <p>EFT is based on 50 years of research into human bonding and 30 years of research from labs run by Susan Johnson, into helping couples connect and thrive. We really don’t have to simply fall in and out of love anymore. Of course, EFT also helps families who are in distress and individuals who want to understand how they connect with others and how best to deal with their needs for support from others.</p>
                <p class="largertext">Attachment-oriented couples therapy</p>
​                <p>Attachment theory offers a map to the dance of love and the powerful emotions that move partners in this dance. In moment-to-moment interactions, cognitive models of personal identity are also shaped. Each person is defined and defines themselves as lovable or unworthy and the other as trustworthy or dangerous. The map offered here allows the therapist to go within each partner and between the partners into the dance and its patterns. The therapist then, with EFT attachment-based interventions, shapes new interactions and new emotions, helping partners move from desperate anger, for example, to a clear expression of fear and longing that evokes caring and compassion in the other partner and creates the contact they long for.</p>
                <p>EFT as an attachment-oriented therapy assumes that reshaped emotions and emotional signals and new sequences of responsive interaction are necessary to transform an attachment relationship. Couples therapy has rightly, from this view, been accused of ignoring nurturance and connection for a focus on conflict management, power and boundaries. This approach addresses this issue as core to forging satisfying and meaningful relationships. Attachment longings are wired into our brains and the tendency to reach and to trust and to comfort and care are always there, even if unrecognized or denied. The tendency to respond to hurtful disconnection by shutting down or attacking is also always there, and can become habitual for all of us.</p>
                <p>Bowlby, like Carl Rogers, saw how we can all get stuck in dead-end ways of dealing with our emotional needs and with loved ones, but also believed that we can have a corrective emotional experience of safe connection that opens new doors for us and changes these ways. </p>
                <p class="largertext">What has to happen—or what is necessary and sufficient for a lasting transformational shift to occur in a distressed relationship?</p>
​                <p>What has to happen — or what is necessary and sufficient for a lasting transformational shift to occur in a distressed relationship? My experience leads me to believe that a corrective emotional experience of safe connection that is then integrated into the self and the relationship is necessary. What does this look like?</p>
                <p>We know from thousands or studies on attachments between mother and child and from studies of adult love that in secure relationships that people can become aware of and regulate their attachment emotions, accept their needs and express these needs coherently and openly to the other. They can accept comfort when offered and, in an adult relationship, offer comfort to the other. They can then use this sense of felt security to move out into the world, to explore and learn. In key change events that predict positive outcome in the second stage of EFT, when the therapist is guiding the couple into positive cycles of engagement and trust, this is also what we see. With both withdrawers and blaming anxious partners, the therapist helps them move into a deeper connection with their own fears and longings, and then express these fears and longings to their partner in a way that pulls the other close.</p>
                <p>Withdrawers assert their needs for safety and can tell their lover what they require to stay emotionally engaged. David says, "I have to feel that I can win here. I can't be walking on eggshells and get doubted and slammed every day. I want to be close. I need your help and a little trust from you." More blaming partners can express their fears and also risk reaching for their partner. David's wife, Sue, can say, "I am so scared of being let down, of going into freefall, but I need your reassurance. I have to know that I matter to you—that you will not let us lose each other."</p>
                <p>When couples can reconnect (or even connect for the first time!) in this way, immensely positive bonding events take place. Partners begin to see each other more fully and are more authentic and compassionate with each other. Their connection empowers each of them and opens the door to all the benefits that research tells us comes with secure attachment. Their way of engaging with their own emotions, their loved one and the world, which now contains a safe haven, shifts. </p>
                <p><em>The research on bonding suggests that as they make this kind of connection, lovers are likely flooded with the cuddle hormone, oxytocin. This is released during orgasm, breast-feeding or simply when attachment figures come close to us. Oxytocin is also linked to the release of dopamine, a natural opiate linked to pleasure, and down-regulates cortisol, the stress hormone. The neurochemical basis of bonding - the physical source of the calm euphoric feeling associated with love - is no longer a mystery. </em> Once a couple can create these kinds of interactions, they can move into the final consolidation phase of EFT. </p>
                <p>The practical application of attachment and associated research findings also leads into exciting new areas. It leads to a new understanding of how to create forgiveness for injuries in attachment relationships. A seven-step process has been outlined and tested (Johnson, 2004). New research also gives the therapist a guide to the integration of sex and attachment, helping us to understand Laumann's recent survey results that the most satisfying sex occurs in long-term loving relationships. The passion of infatuation is perhaps just the hors d'oeuvre rather than the main meal. </p>
                <p class="largertext">Emotional presence and engagement are the keys to sex that remains thrilling, rather than seeking novelty or needing distance to spark desire</p>
                <p>Emotional presence and engagement are the keys to sex that remains thrilling, rather than seeking novelty or needing distance to spark desire (see the chapter on this in Hold Me Tight). A new understanding of love also extends the reach of the couples therapist. EFT is used to create safe-haven relationships for those who are traumatized. If we can heal relationships, we can also create relationships that heal. A safe, loving relationship is the natural antidote to the emotional tsunami of trauma.</p>
